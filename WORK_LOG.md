| Mar 5   |  2:30-3:00  | Talked about it with Mr. Blick and Tyler. We talked about what if we made a substring of all possible outcomes if you were to substitute, add, or substract the words and then getting all real words from that long list of words yeah. |
| Mar 7   | 12:35-1:45  |                                                                                                     Talked to Mr. Blick and Tyler explored the idea of using hash key/map. Taking pairs of letter hashing them adding word to that index |
| Mar 12  | 12:25-12:55 |                                                                                                                                                                                          Started to work on the edit distance code stuff |
| Mar 14  |  8:50-9:55  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
