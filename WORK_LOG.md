We talked about what if we made a substring of all possible outcomes if you were to substitute, add, or substract the words and then getting all real words from that long list of words yeah. |

Taking pairs of letter hashing them adding word to that index |

| Mar 17  |  1:50-3:00  | I finished the autocorrect edit distance part. My initial problem I was having is that I had mixed up the lengths of my columns/rows with the words. My next error after that was that I had forgot to add one when I was going through my tabulation for my edit distance. After fixing all that I was having trouble combining my multiple arrays of words based on thresholds. I asked Tyler for help and he helped me fix it. Then I had it approved by Mr. Blick. My next steps is to work on k pairs to narrow down candidates. |

I finished my hash function based on the one I used in DNA. I then started to make the code that will hopefully fill up the table with the words at the correct spots. |

Afterwards I need to work on the edge case in which it is not hashedset but is edit distance of two away |

I also implemented doing nothing when the word is a word and saying no matches when there are no matches. |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
